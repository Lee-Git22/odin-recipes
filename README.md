# odin-recipes
This is a project designed and posted on "The Odin Project" to practice key concepts in the HTML unit of the Foundations course. 
In this project, I will be making a basic website showing 3 recipes  with only HTML.

Some reflection and notes after completion this project:
The most important lesson I learned was that paying attention to line breaks and proper use of nesting for tags is very important for keeping everything organized.
I found that it was hard to make a visually compelling website using only simple HTML tags. 
Overall the project is not very difficult, but the results are also not very impressive given the simplicity of the tags I used - in the future when I learn more about CSS I hope to improve the visuals on this webpage.
