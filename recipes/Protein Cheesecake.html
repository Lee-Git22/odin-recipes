        <h2>Ingredients</h2>
            <h4>For the Crust</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>3/4 cup (75g) protein pancake mix OR 3/4 cup of any flour with a few grams of splenda</li>
                    <li>1/2 cup (113g) unsweetened applesauce</li>
                </ul>
            <h4>For the Filling</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>3 cups (681g) plain nonfat Greek yogurt</li>
                    <li>1 oz (30g) sugar free vanilla pudding mix</li>
                    <li>2 tsp (8g) splenda</li>
                    <li>13 tbsp (200g) liquid egg whites</li>
                </ul>
            <h4>For the Topping</h4>
                <ul>
                    <li>1 and 1/2 cups (200g) frozen fruit</li>
                    <li>1 cup (64g) fat free whipped cream</li>
                    <li>1/2 (2g) splenda</li>
                </ul>
        <br>

        <h2>Steps</h2>
            <h4>For the Crust</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>Preheat your oven to 350Â°F.</li>
                    <li>Mix the protein pancake mix and applesauce together until it has combined.</li>
                    <li>Spray an 8 inch pie pan or springform pan with oil and add the crust mixture to the dish. Using a spoon, spread the mixture around the bottom of the pan (and up the sides of the dish if using pie pan) in an even layer as best as you can. </li>
                    <li>Parbake for 5-10 minutes or until it is no longer wet to the touch while you prepare the filling. The pie pan will likely be ready quicker as it isn't as thick.</li>
                </ol>
            <h4>For the Filling</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>In a large bowl, mix together the yogurt, splenda, pudding mix, and egg whites until incorporated. </li>
                    <li>Once the crust has parbaked, pour in the filling and smooth out in an even layer. </li>
                    <li>Bake for 30 minutes. Use a waterbath if you don't want it to crack. </li>
                    <li>Allow the cheesecake to cool to room temperature and then place it in the fridge to set for at least 3 hours, preferably overnight. </li>
                </ol>
            <h4>Serving</h4>
                <ol>
                    <li>Thaw out the frozen fruit in the microwave and sprinkle splenda over the top. Mix and allow to macerate for a couple of minutes. </li>
                    <li>This recipe makes 8 servings. Cut the cheesecake into 8 equal slices and top with frozen fruit and 2 tbsp of whipped cream each.</li>
                </ol>
